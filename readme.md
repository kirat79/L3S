# L3S - Enhancing Blockchain Security and Interoperability

Blockchain networks face several challenges, such as permissionless validation, secure decentralized validation, and seamless interoperability while avoiding centralization. **L3S** is designed to address these issues by providing efficient and shared security using liquid staking and advanced blockchain technologies.

## üåü Key Features

### 1. **Liquid Staking with lETH**
- Users can lock their ETH to receive **lETH**, which offers staking rewards while keeping assets liquid.
- Enables **cross-chain transfers**, allowing seamless movement of assets between different blockchain networks.

### 2. **Secure Validator Setup**
- L3S supports the creation of secure validators, ensuring network integrity and security.
- Implements an algorithm based on the Total Value Locked (TVL) to validator ratio, reducing costs while maintaining security.

### 3. **Enhanced Data Accessibility**
- Uses **Avail Data Availability (DA)** to ensure smooth and reliable data sharing across blockchain networks.
- Facilitates efficient integration of various Orbit chains into the consensus layer.

### 4. **Dispute Resolution and Validation**
- Implements the **BoLD protocol** to prioritize security and handle disputes effectively.

### 5. **Scalability and Interoperability**
- Designed to scale easily, enabling new Orbit chains to join the consensus layer.
- Enhances cross-chain compatibility using **Hyperlane** for secure and seamless asset transfers.

### 6. **Transparency and Monitoring**
- Integrates **Blockscout**, an open-source blockchain explorer, to provide insights into blockchain data.
- Allows users to track transactions and monitor the overall health of the network.
